# Group Anagram
## Summary
- Given an array of strings group the strings that are anagrams and return an array with those groups

## Input
- Array

## Base Case

## Brute Force
- Perhaps do a for loop and make a dic for each one then compare the dic to see if the string has the same amount of char if it does then append that one to another array
